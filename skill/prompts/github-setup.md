# GitHub Backup Setup — Structured Prompts

Intelligent prompts for handling database backups stored in GitHub repositories.

## When User Mentions GitHub

User says something like:
- "I have a backup in GitHub"
- "The export is in a private repo"
- "Can you pull from GitHub?"
- "The backup is at github.com/org/repo"

## Structured Information Gathering

Gather these fields in order:

### 1. Repository URL
```
Question: "What's the repository URL?"
Expected: https://github.com/org/repo
Examples: 
  - https://github.com/lightspeedwp/backup-archive
  - https://github.com/myteam/wordpress-exports
Pattern: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>
```

### 2. Branch/Reference (Optional)
```
Question: "Which branch? (default: main)"
Expected: main, develop, releases, etc.
Smart Default: 'main' (most common)
Pattern: Detect if not provided
```

### 3. File Path in Repository
```
Question: "Where's the backup file?"
Expected: backups/production.sql.gz
Examples:
  - backups/prod-2026-10-29.sql.gz
  - exports/database.sql
  - releases/v2.0/backup.sql.zip
Pattern: Support wildcards: backups/*.sql.gz
```

### 4. Authentication (If Private)
```
Question: "Is this a private repository?"
Logic:
  - Public: Use HTTPS clone
  - Private: Ask for auth method
    - "SSH key available?" → Use SSH
    - "GitHub PAT?" → Use HTTPS with token
Options:
  - Skip (assumes public)
  - SSH
  - GitHub Personal Access Token
  - GitHub App token
```

## Smart Detection

Automatically handle variations:

```bash
# Detect if already public
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo> \
  | jq '.private' # false = public

# Find backup files automatically
# Search for: *.sql, *.sql.gz, *.sql.zip, *.sql.bz2

# Detect file size to estimate complexity
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path> \
  | jq '.size'
```

## Automation Script

Create: `skill/scripts/github-backup-setup.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# github-backup-setup.sh
# Handles GitHub backup repository setup

REPO_URL="${1:-}"
BRANCH="${2:-main}"
FILE_PATH="${3:-}"
AUTH_METHOD="${4:-auto}"

show_usage() {
    cat << 'EOF'
GitHub Backup Setup

USAGE:
  ./github-backup-setup.sh <repo-url> [branch] [file-path] [auth]

ARGUMENTS:
  repo-url       GitHub repository URL
  branch         Branch name (default: main)
  file-path      Path to backup file in repo
  auth           Authentication: auto|ssh|https|token

EXAMPLES:
  # Public repo with auto-detection
  ./github-backup-setup.sh https://github.com/org/repo backups/prod.sql.gz

  # Private repo with SSH
  ./github-backup-setup.sh https://github.com/org/repo main \
    backups/production.sql.gz ssh

  # Private repo with PAT
  ./github-backup-setup.sh https://github.com/org/repo main \
    releases/backup.sql.gz token

## One-Command Workflow

```bash
# All in one (if you want the skill to handle it)
./github-backup-setup.sh <repo> <branch> <file-path> | \
  source /dev/stdin && \
  ../create-and-migrate.sh my-site "$BACKUP_FILE" old.com new.local && \
  rm -rf "$BACKUP_REPO"
```

## Error Handling

### File Not Found
```
❌ File not found: backups/prod.sql.gz

Available files:
  - backups/production-2026-10-29.sql.gz
  - backups/staging-2026-10-28.sql.gz
  - exports/archive-2026-10-27.sql.zip

Did you mean: production-2026-10-29.sql.gz?
```

### Auth Failed
```
❌ Authentication failed

Private repository requires authentication.
Options:
  1. Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
  2. Configure SSH key (ssh-keygen)
  3. Use GitHub App token
```

### Size Detection
```
📊 Large backup detected: 850 MB

⚠️  This might take 5-10 minutes to:
  1. Clone repository
  2. Extract backup
  3. Migrate database

Continue? (yes/no)
```

## Integration with Skill

The skill will offer this automatically:

```
User: "I have a backup in GitHub"

Skill: "Perfect! Let me help you set that up.

📋 I'll need:
   1. Repository URL
   2. Backup file location
   3. Authentication (if private)

Where's your backup?"
```

Then it can:
1. ✅ Run `github-backup-setup.sh` with answers
2. ✅ Use returned file path in `create-and-migrate.sh`
3. ✅ Auto-detect complexity from file size
4. ✅ Set appropriate task budget

**Status:** Ready to integrate  
**Time to Implement:** ~30 minutes  
**User Time Saved:** ~3 minutes per migration
