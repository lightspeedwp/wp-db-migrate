### Step 1: Copy the Skill to Your Project

#### Option A: Clone the Repository

# From your project root
git clone https://github.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate.git

# Or add as a submodule (recommended for git projects)
git submodule add https://github.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate.git skills/wp-db-migrate
```

#### Option B: Use Symlink (macOS/Linux)

```bash
# Link from your .claude/skills/ folder
ln -s /path/to/wp-db-migrate/skill ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate
```

#### Option C: Copy to Your Project

### Updating to Latest Version

## Method 3: CLI Scripts Only (No Claude)

**Best for:** CI/CD automation, servers, standalone usage.

### Step 1: Download Scripts

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate.git

# Or download specific scripts
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate/main/skill/scripts/wp-migrate-clone-to-studio.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate/main/skill/scripts/lib-*.sh
```

### Step 2: Make Executable

```bash
chmod +x wp-migrate-clone-to-studio.sh
chmod +x lib-*.sh
```

### Step 3: Add to PATH (Optional)

```bash
# Add to your PATH so you can run from anywhere
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/wp-db-migrate/skill/scripts"

# Or copy to /usr/local/bin
sudo cp skill/scripts/*.sh /usr/local/bin/
```

### Step 4: Use Directly

```bash
# Run from any directory
./wp-migrate-clone-to-studio.sh --from URL --to PATH

# Or if in PATH
wp-migrate-clone-to-studio.sh --from URL --to PATH
```

## Dependencies Check

Before using the tool, make sure you have:

### Required on Your Machine

- ✅ **WordPress Studio** — [Download](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/)
- ✅ **wp-cli** — `brew install wp-cli` (macOS) or [Install guide](https://wp-cli.org/)
- ✅ **gzip** — Usually pre-installed
- ✅ **bash** — macOS/Linux have this by default

### Required on Remote Server (for SSH export)

- ✅ **SSH access** — To your staging/production server
- ✅ **wp-cli** — Installed on the remote server
- ✅ **WP-CLI rights** — User can run `wp db export`

### Quick Dependency Check

```bash
# Run this to verify everything is installed
./skill/scripts/preflight-check.sh

# Output will show:
# ✓ WordPress Studio installed
# ✓ wp-cli installed
# ✓ gzip available
# ✓ SSH configured (if using SSH export)
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

### "Skill not appearing in Settings"

1. Make sure the skill is in the correct directory:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate/
   ```

2. Restart Claude Code (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)

3. Check the skill folder structure:
   ```bash
   # Should have SKILL.md at minimum
   ls ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate/
   SKILL.md
   scripts/
   plugin/
   ```

### "Command not found when running script"

1. Make sure it's executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x wp-migrate-clone-to-studio.sh
   ```

2. Run with full path:
   ```bash
   ./wp-migrate-clone-to-studio.sh --help
   ```

3. Or add to PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/skill/scripts"
   ```

### "preflight-check.sh shows missing dependencies"

sudo mv wp-cli.phar /usr/local/bin/wp
```

**SSH Access:**
```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@staging.example.com 'echo Connected'
```
