# Developer Onboarding Checklist: wp-db-migrate

Complete this checklist to get wp-db-migrate set up and ready to use on your machine.

**Estimated Time:** 30–45 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** macOS with Homebrew, basic terminal familiarity

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Verify Your Machine (5 minutes)

Your machine needs the right tools installed before you can use wp-db-migrate.

### Step 1.1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone to your preferred location
git clone https://github.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate.git
cd wp-db-migrate
```

- [ ] Repository cloned successfully
- [ ] You're in the `wp-db-migrate` directory

### Step 1.2: Check Dependencies

```bash
# Run the automated dependency check
./skill/scripts/setup-dependencies.sh --verbose
```

**What you should see:**
- ✓ All required dependencies (green checkmarks)
- ✓ Optional dependencies (some may show as yellow/optional)
- Summary showing: "All required dependencies are installed!"

- [ ] Dependency check completed
- [ ] All required dependencies are installed

### Step 1.3: Install Missing Dependencies (if needed)

If the dependency check showed missing tools:

```bash
# Automatically install via Homebrew
./skill/scripts/setup-dependencies.sh --install

# OR install manually (see Setup Requirements guide)
# Individual tool installation docs: https://github.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate/docs/setup-requirements.md
```

**Troubleshooting:** See [Setup Requirements Guide](./setup-requirements.md#troubleshooting)

- [ ] Missing dependencies installed (if any)
- [ ] Re-run dependency check to verify: `./skill/scripts/setup-dependencies.sh`

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Install Project Dependencies (5 minutes)

Set up Node.js packages needed for testing and development.

### Step 2.1: Install NPM Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Wait for installation to complete (may take 2–3 minutes on first run).

- [ ] `npm install` completed without errors
- [ ] `node_modules/` folder created

### Step 2.2: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Check NPM version  
npm --version

# Verify packages installed
ls -la node_modules | head -20
```

- [ ] Node.js is version 14.0 or higher
- [ ] NPM is version 6.0 or higher
- [ ] `node_modules/` contains packages

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Run Tests (5 minutes)

Verify everything is working correctly by running the test suite.

### Step 3.1: Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

This runs the full test suite (should take 1–2 minutes).

**Expected output:**
```
Test Suites: 15 passed, 15 total
Tests:       192 passed, 192 total
```

- [ ] All test suites passed
- [ ] 192 tests passed
- [ ] No test failures

### Step 3.2: Run Tests with Coverage (optional)

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

- [ ] Coverage report generated (optional verification)
- [ ] Coverage > 85% for all files

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Verify Scripts Work (5 minutes)

Test that the migration scripts run correctly.

### Step 4.1: Check Preflight

```bash
./skill/scripts/preflight-check.sh
```

This runs detailed environment checks.

**Expected output:**
- Database drivers detected
- WordPress Studio availability confirmed
- Storage space confirmed

- [ ] Preflight check passed
- [ ] All requirements confirmed

### Step 4.2: Test Help Command

```bash
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh --help
```

This should display usage information for the main migration script.

- [ ] Help displayed successfully
- [ ] Script is executable and working

### Step 4.3: Test Dry-Run Mode (optional)

```bash
# Create a test directory first (if you have WordPress Studio)
# ./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery-enhanced.sh --dry-run ~/Studio/test-site "https://example.com" "https://test.local"
```

*Skip this step if you don't have WordPress Studio set up yet.*

- [ ] Dry-run mode works (or skipped if no test site)

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Understand the Tool (10 minutes)

Read the essential documentation to understand how wp-db-migrate works.

### Step 5.1: Read Getting Started

Open and read: [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)

**Key concepts to understand:**
- The 5-stage migration workflow
- How to run your first migration
- Common options and flags

- [ ] You've read the Getting Started guide
- [ ] You understand the 5-stage workflow

### Step 5.2: Review Best Practices

Open and read: [Best Practices Guide](./best-practices.md)

**Key concepts:**
- Safe migration strategies
- Backup procedures
- When to use dry-run mode
- How to handle production databases

- [ ] You've read Best Practices
- [ ] You know how to run migrations safely

### Step 5.3: Bookmark Documentation

Bookmark these links for quick reference:

- [ ] [Setup Requirements](./setup-requirements.md) — Dependencies & troubleshooting
- [ ] [Team Installation](./TEAM-INSTALLATION.md) — How to install for your team
- [ ] [FAQ](./faq.md) — 30+ common questions
- [ ] [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) — Problem solving guide
- [ ] [Reliability Guide](./reliability.md) — Error recovery & resilience

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Connect with Your Team (5 minutes)

Get aligned with your team on how to use wp-db-migrate.

### Step 6.1: Ask About Team Workflows

Talk to your team lead about:

- [ ] Which installation method your team uses (Skill, Plugin, or CLI)
- [ ] Where to find team configuration files (`.wp-db-migrate.conf`)
- [ ] Your team's standard migration process
- [ ] Any team-specific documentation or workflows

### Step 6.2: Enable in Claude (if using Skill/Plugin)

If your team uses the Claude Skill or Plugin:

```bash
# For Skill installation:
# Open Claude Code → Settings → Skills
# Find "wp-db-migrate" and toggle it on
```

**Or for Plugin:**
```
# In Claude → Settings → Plugins
# Add from GitHub: https://github.com/lightspeedwp/wp-db-migrate
```

- [ ] Skill/Plugin enabled in Claude (if applicable)
- [ ] You can see `/wp-migrate-clone-to-studio` command available
