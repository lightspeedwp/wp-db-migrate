## 🔧 Critical Tools You Need

These must be installed **globally** on your machine:

### 1. WordPress Studio (Latest)
```bash
# Download latest from https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/
# Or install via script:
curl -fsSL https://wordpress.studio/install.sh | bash
```
**Why:** Local WordPress development environment  
**Important:** Keep it up to date for compatibility

### 2. WP-CLI (WordPress Command Line)
```bash
brew install wp-cli
```
**Why:** Database export/import and site management  
**Crucial:** wp-db-migrate uses this for all database operations

### 3. Studio CLI
```bash
# Included with WordPress Studio
studio --version
```
**Why:** Manage local WordPress Studio sites  
**Crucial:** Handles the import and validation steps

### 4. SSH Key Setup (for remote databases)
```bash
# Generate if you don't have one:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@lightspeed.agency"

# Add to remote server:
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your-key user@staging.example.com

# Test connection:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key user@staging.example.com
```
**Why:** Export databases from staging/production servers  
**Crucial:** Required for remote database migration

## 🛠️ Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Clone Staging to Local Development

```bash
# 1. Create a WordPress Studio site
studio create my-project

# 2. Run migration (interactive)
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/my-project \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://my-project.local"

# 3. Site is ready with staging data
studio open my-project
```

### Workflow 2: Export from Remote Server

```bash
# Uses SSH to export directly from production/staging
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/my-project \
  "https://example.com" \
  "https://my-project.local" \
  --ssh-host staging.example.com \
  --ssh-user deploy \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/deploy_key
```

### Workflow 3: Reduce Large Database

For large databases (>500MB), you can:

**Option A: Scan and propose reductions**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Ask wp-db-migrate to analyze and suggest reductions
./skill/scripts/preflight-check.sh

# Then specify exclusions:
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/my-project \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://my-project.local" \
  --exclude-tables wp_postmeta,wp_actionscheduler_logs,wp_cache
```

**Option B: Use pre-configured profiles**
```bash
# Copy team config with optimized settings
cp .wp-db-migrate.conf.sample .wp-db-migrate.conf

# Edit to your needs:
# EXCLUDE_TABLES=wp_postmeta,wp_actionscheduler_logs
# COMPRESS=true
# PARALLEL_JOBS=4
```

**Option C: Dry-run first to see what will be removed**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery-enhanced.sh --dry-run \
  ~/.studio/sites/my-project \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://my-project.local" \
  --exclude-tables wp_postmeta
```

See: **[Large Database Handling Guide](./large-databases.md)** for detailed strategies

## 🔗 Integration with LightSpeed Hosting Tools & WordPress Skills

### Complete Workflow: Production → Local → Staging

wp-db-migrate works with **ls-hosting-*** skills for complete end-to-end workflows:

**Step 1: Extract from Production (use ls-hosting)**
```bash
/ls-hosting-sync-live-to-staging    # Get database backup
/ls-hosting-fetch-tools             # Get plugins/themes
```

**Step 2: Migrate Locally (use wp-db-migrate)**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/my-project \
  "https://production.example.com" \
  "https://my-project.local"
```

**Step 3: Configure & Develop (use WordPress agent skills)**
```bash
# For WordPress-specific development help
/wp-plugin-development      # Plugin architecture
/wp-block-development       # Gutenberg blocks
/wp-wpcli-and-ops          # WP-CLI operations
```

**Step 4: Deploy Changes (use ls-hosting)**
```bash
/ls-hosting-deploy-full-site        # Deploy to staging
/ls-hosting-sync-content            # Sync to production
```

See: **[ls-hosting Integration Guide](./ls-hosting-integration.md)** for complete workflow details

## 💡 What You Need to Know: Basics

### 1. WordPress Studio Sites
- Each developer should have WordPress Studio sites for local work
- Sites are isolated SQLite databases (not MySQL)
- wp-db-migrate converts MySQL → SQLite automatically

### 2. The 5-Stage Workflow

```
Stage 1: Export Database
  └─ From MySQL/MariaDB (remote or local)

Stage 2: Sanitize
  └─ Remove MySQL-only syntax, exclude large tables

Stage 3: Import
  └─ Into WordPress Studio (SQLite)

Stage 4: Replace URLs
  └─ Production URL → localhost URL

Stage 5: Validate
  └─ Verify integrity, load test, count checks
```

### 3. Dry-Run Mode (Always Use First)
```bash
--dry-run    # Preview without making changes
```
This shows exactly what will happen without committing.

### 4. Backup & Recovery
- Automatic backup created before import
- Auto-rollback on failure
- Manual recovery possible anytime

### 5. Performance Tuning
```bash
--jobs 4           # Parallel processing (adjust based on CPU)
--no-compress      # Skip compression (if network is fast)
--exclude-tables   # Skip large tables (logs, cache, etc.)
```

## ❓ Common Questions (Quick Answers)

**Q: Is it safe to run on production data?**  
A: No. Always export during off-hours, test on fresh sites first.

**Q: What if the import times out?**  
A: Data usually imports fine anyway. Run `verify-import.sh` to check.

**Q: Can I rollback after importing?**  
A: Yes. Backup is created before import.

**Q: Should I exclude logging tables?**  
A: Yes. `wp_actionscheduler_logs` is safe to exclude and speeds up.

**Q: How do I reduce a 5GB database to manageable size?**  
A: See: [Large Database Handling Guide](./large-databases.md)

See: **[Full FAQ](./faq.md)** for 30+ questions

## 📋 Best Practices Summary

✅ **Always** use dry-run first  
✅ **Always** backup before import

✅ **Don't** migrate during production hours  
✅ **Don't** trust untested migrations  
✅ **Do** exclude non-essential tables  
✅ **Do** use compression for large databases  
✅ **Do** verify your SSH setup before remote export
