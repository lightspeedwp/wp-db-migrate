# Pre-Rollout Test Plan: wp-db-migrate Workflow

Complete testing plan for validating wp-db-migrate with a team member before full team rollout.

**Duration:** 1.5-2 hours (includes troubleshooting margins)  
**Goal:** Verify complete workflow works smoothly and identify any blockers  
**Test Environment:** Staging database (non-critical data)  
**Success Criteria:** All steps complete without critical errors

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Test Setup (15 minutes)

### 1.1 Schedule & Preparation
- [ ] Schedule test session (1.5-2 hours with team member)
- [ ] Provide team member with: TEAM-ANNOUNCEMENT.md + ONBOARDING-CHECKLIST.md
- [ ] Prepare test database export (from staging, ~200-500MB recommended)
- [ ] Create empty WordPress Studio site for testing
- [ ] Have SSH access details ready (if testing remote export)
- [ ] Prepare feedback collection form (see end of this plan)

### 1.2 Verify Test Environment
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Verify dependencies on test machine
./skill/scripts/setup-dependencies.sh --verbose

# Expected: All required dependencies installed ✓
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Bash shell available
- [ ] WordPress Studio installed and running
- [ ] WP-CLI available
- [ ] git installed
- [ ] SSH keys configured (if testing remote export)

### 1.3 Create Test WordPress Studio Site
```bash
studio create test-migrate-site
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Site created successfully
- [ ] Site accessible at localhost
- [ ] Database exists in ~/Studio/test-migrate-site

---

## Phase 2: Basic Workflow Test (45 minutes)

### 2.1 Dry-Run Mode (10 minutes)
**Goal:** Preview migration without making changes

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Run with dry-run flag
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery-enhanced.sh --dry-run \
  ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-site \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://test-migrate-site.local"
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Script starts successfully
- [ ] Database analysis completes
- [ ] Shows: table count, row count, total size
- [ ] Shows: suggested exclusions
- [ ] Estimated import time displayed
- [ ] No errors in output
- [ ] Output is color-coded (green ✓, yellow ⚠️)

**Expected output includes:**
```
✓ Database Analysis
├─ Tables: 42 found
├─ Rows: 1.2M total
├─ Size: 450MB uncompressed
└─ Estimated: 120-150 seconds import time

Suggested Exclusions (won't break site):
  - wp_actionscheduler_logs (145MB)
  - wp_cache (78MB)
```

### 2.2 Actual Migration (25 minutes)
**Goal:** Complete full migration workflow

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Run actual migration (no --dry-run)
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-site \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://test-migrate-site.local"
```

**Watch for these stages:**

**Stage 1: Export Database** (2-5 min)
- [ ] ✓ Export database message
- [ ] ✓ Spinner animating
- [ ] ✓ "Complete" message

**Stage 2: Sanitize Database** (1-2 min)
- [ ] ✓ Sanitizing output
- [ ] ✓ MySQL → SQLite conversion shown
- [ ] ✓ "Complete" message

**Stage 3: Backup & Import** (30-60 sec)
- [ ] ✓ Backup created message
- [ ] ✓ Import starting
- [ ] ✓ Progress indicator (if shown)
- [ ] ✓ "Import Complete" message

**Stage 4: URL Replacement** (2-5 min)
- [ ] ✓ Dry-run counts shown
- [ ] ✓ Asks for approval
- [ ] ✓ Apply replacement confirmed
- [ ] ✓ "URLs replaced" message

**Stage 5: Validation** (1-2 min)
- [ ] ✓ Site load test (HTTP 200)
- [ ] ✓ Table count verification
- [ ] ✓ Database integrity check
- [ ] ✓ "Validation Complete" message

### 2.3 Post-Migration Verification (10 minutes)
**Goal:** Verify data integrity and site functionality

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Verify import success
./skill/scripts/verify-import.sh ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-site
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] ✓ Database check passes
- [ ] ✓ Table count matches source
- [ ] ✓ Row count matches source
- [ ] ✓ No corruption detected

**Manual verification in WordPress Studio:**
```bash
# Open site in browser
studio open test-migrate-site
```

**What to verify in browser:**
- [ ] ✓ Site loads (no 500 errors)
- [ ] ✓ WordPress dashboard accessible
- [ ] ✓ At least one post visible
- [ ] ✓ At least one page visible
- [ ] ✓ Navigation menus working
- [ ] ✓ Media library loads
- [ ] ✓ Site URL correct (should be test-migrate-site.local)

**CLI verification:**
```bash
cd ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-site

# Check site is installed
wp core is-installed
# Expected: Success

# Check post count (should match source)
wp post list --format=count
# Expected: Number > 0

# Check site URL
wp option get siteurl
# Expected: https://test-migrate-site.local
```

---

## Phase 3: Database Size Reduction Testing (30 minutes)

### 3.1 Create New Test Site (5 min)
```bash
studio create test-migrate-minimal
```

### 3.2 Test with Exclusions (20 min)
**Goal:** Verify size reduction works

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Migration with table exclusions
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-minimal \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://test-migrate-minimal.local" \
  --exclude-tables wp_actionscheduler_logs,wp_cache,wp_activity_log
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] ✓ Script completes successfully
- [ ] ✓ Exclusion messages shown (tables being skipped)
- [ ] ✓ Final file size is smaller than dry-run showed
- [ ] ✓ Import time is faster than first test
- [ ] ✓ Site still functions properly after import

**Measure size reduction:**
```bash
# Compare the sizes
# Test 1 (full): Note the final size
# Test 2 (minimal): Note the final size
# Calculate: (full - minimal) / full × 100% = reduction percentage
# Expected: 40-60% reduction with default exclusions
```

### 3.3 Verify Site Still Works (5 min)
```bash
# Open and test minimal migration
studio open test-migrate-minimal

# CLI verification
cd ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-minimal
wp post list | head -3
wp page list | head -3
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] ✓ Site loads normally
- [ ] ✓ Posts visible
- [ ] ✓ Pages visible
- [ ] ✓ No critical features missing

---

## Phase 4: Remote Database Export Testing (20 minutes)
**SKIP if no staging server access; test with local export instead**

### 4.1 Test SSH Connection (5 min)
```bash
# Create new test site
studio create test-migrate-ssh

# Test SSH connection first (use your SSH key path)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key user@staging.example.com 'echo Connected'
# Expected: "Connected"

# Verify WP-CLI on remote
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key user@staging.example.com 'wp --version'
# Expected: version number
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] ✓ SSH connection works
- [ ] ✓ WP-CLI available on remote
- [ ] ✓ SSH key permissions correct (600)

### 4.2 Run Remote Migration (15 min)
```bash
# Migration directly from remote server
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/Studio/test-migrate-ssh \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://test-migrate-ssh.local" \
  --ssh-host staging.example.com \
  --ssh-user deploy \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/your-key
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] ✓ SSH connection established
- [ ] ✓ Remote database exported via SSH
- [ ] ✓ No "Connection refused" errors
- [ ] ✓ No "Permission denied" errors
- [ ] ✓ Entire workflow completes successfully
- [ ] ✓ Final site works correctly

---

## Phase 5: Error Scenarios Testing (15 minutes)
**Test how errors are handled**

### 5.1 Test Missing WordPress Studio Site (5 min)
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Try to migrate to non-existent site
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/non-existent-site \
  "https://staging.example.com" \
  "https://test.local"
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] ✓ Script fails gracefully
- [ ] ✓ Error message is clear
- [ ] ✓ Explains what's wrong (site not found)
- [ ] ✓ Suggests solution (create site first)

### 5.2 Test Invalid Source URL (5 min)

# Try with invalid URL
./skill/scripts/migrate-recovery.sh \
  ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-site \
  "https://non-existent-staging-url.com" \
  "https://test.local"
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] ✓ Script fails gracefully
- [ ] ✓ Error message is clear
- [ ] ✓ No partial data left behind
- [ ] ✓ Site remains intact (rollback works)

### 5.3 Test Verification (5 min)
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wp-db-migrate

# Run verify on site that had errors
./skill/scripts/verify-import.sh ~/.studio/sites/test-migrate-site
```

**What to verify:**
- [ ] ✓ Verify script doesn't crash on incomplete sites
- [ ] ✓ Reports status clearly
- [ ] ✓ Provides helpful troubleshooting info
